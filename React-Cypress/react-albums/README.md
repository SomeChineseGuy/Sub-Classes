# M8W21 - End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### To Do

- [ ] Jest vs Cypress
- [ ] Install and Configure Cypress
- [ ] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### Jest vs Cypress

- Jest
  - Command line test runner
  - Based around testing `assertions`
  - Used for unit and integration testing (mostly)
- Cypress
  - Runs its own browser to execute the tests in
  - Performs operations and interacts with the site the way that a user would (eg. typing into input fields, clicking on buttons)
  - Used for integration and E2E testing (mostly)
